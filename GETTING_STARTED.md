## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

**Check if ports are in use:**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
lsof -i :5173
lsof -i :8000
lsof -i :5432

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
```

**Solution:** Stop the conflicting service or change ports in `docker-compose.yml`

### Frontend Shows Connection Error

**Check backend is running:**
```bash
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Solution:** Restart backend
```bash
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Database Connection Error

**Check PostgreSQL:**
```bash
docker-compose logs postgres
```

**Solution:** Recreate database
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

### "Authentication Failed"

**Solution:** Clear browser local storage
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application > Local Storage
3. Delete all items
4. Refresh page

## ðŸ“Š Viewing Logs

**All services:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Specific service:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
docker-compose logs -f postgres
```

## ðŸ›‘ Stopping the Application

**Stop but keep data:**
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

**Stop and remove containers:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

**Stop and remove everything (including database):**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## ðŸ”„ Updating the Application

```bash
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful titles** for ideas and use cases
2. **Be specific** in problem statements and descriptions
3. **Add market signals** to improve viability scores
4. **Set appropriate importance weights** for use cases
5. **Tag use cases well** for better matching
