## üéØ Why This Structure?

### Sprint 2 as Buffer Sprint
**Traditional agile best practice**:
- After major release (Sprint 1 MVP), teams need time for:
  - User testing and feedback collection
  - Bug fixing and stabilization
  - Technical debt paydown
  - Documentation updates

**Flexible planning**:
- Can't know what bugs will appear until MVP is live
- Can't predict what users will request until they test
- Placeholder issues reserve capacity for this work

**Real-world example**:
After Sprint 1 demo, users might say:
- "The signup form is confusing" ‚Üí Create UX improvement issue
- "AI analysis is too slow" ‚Üí Create performance optimization issue
- "Can't find my old ideas" ‚Üí Create search improvement issue

These go into Sprint 2, replacing/supplementing the placeholders.

---

### v1.0 Release vs Sprint 6

**Sprint 6** = Time-boxed development sprint (Feb 2-15)
- 5 critical features needed for launch
- Fixed deadline and scope
- Must be completed for v1.0

**v2.0 Backlog** = Flexible feature backlog (no deadline)
- 17 "nice to have" features
- Can be done anytime post-launch
- Prioritized based on user feedback after v1.0
- May slip to v1.1, v1.2, v2.0, or even be deprioritized

**Key difference**:
- **Sprint** = Time commitment
- **Backlog** = Feature repository
