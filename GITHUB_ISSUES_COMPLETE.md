## ‚ö†Ô∏è One Manual Step Remaining

### GitHub Project Board (2 minutes to create)

**Why manual?**
- Requires additional GitHub CLI permissions (`project`, `read:project`)
- Easier to create via web UI with visual templates

**How to create:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/Yuvaraj1Aravindan/Startup-VC/projects

2. Click **"New Project"**

3. Choose template: **"Team backlog"** or **"Board"**

4. Name it: **"Startup-VC Development"**

5. Add your 3 issues (#1, #2, #3) to the board

6. Organize into columns:
   - üìã **Backlog** - Future work
   - üîú **To Do** - Ready for this sprint
   - üèÉ **In Progress** - Currently working
   - üëÄ **In Review** - Testing/review
   - ‚úÖ **Done** - Completed

**Alternative (if you want CLI):**
```bash
gh auth refresh -s project,read:project
gh project create --owner "@me" --title "Startup-VC Development"
```

# Make changes
# Commit with issue reference
git commit -m "test: Add VC agent test suite (#1)"
```

### 3. Push & Create PR
```bash
git push origin feature/issue-1-vc-agent-testing
gh pr create --title "Test VC Agent" --body "Closes #1"

## üìä Tracking Progress

### Sprint View (via Project Board)
1. Go to your project board

gh issue list --milestone "Sprint 1 - MVP Features"

# View all milestones
gh api repos/Yuvaraj1Aravindan/Startup-VC/milestones
```

### Label View

   gh issue list --milestone "Sprint 1 - MVP Features"
   
   # Pick an issue and view details
   gh issue view 1
   ```

2. **During development:**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch named after issue
   git checkout -b feature/issue-1-description
   
   # Make commits referencing issue
   git commit -m "feat: Add feature (#1)"
   ```

3. **After completing work:**
   ```bash
   # Sync to GitHub and Azure VM
   ./sync-all.sh "feat: Complete issue #1"

## üìà Best Practices

### 1. Write Good Titles
- ‚ùå Bad: "Fix bug"
- ‚úÖ Good: "[BUG] Login fails with invalid credentials"

### 2. Use Labels Consistently
- Add type label: `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `story`
- Add component label: `frontend`, `backend`, `database`
- Add priority: `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`

### 3. Keep Issues Small
- 1 issue = 1-3 days of work maximum
- Break large features into multiple issues
- Use epics for tracking related issues

### 4. Update Regularly
- Comment on blockers or questions
- Update progress on project board
- Close issues when truly done

### 5. Link Everything
- Link issues to PRs
- Reference related issues
- Link to documentation
