---

### Small Team (2-5 people)
**Recommendation**: **GitHub Issues** or **Azure DevOps** ✅

**GitHub Issues if:**
- Code-first workflow
- Simple needs
- Want fast setup
- Prefer lightweight tools

**Azure DevOps if:**
- Heavy Azure usage
- Need advanced reporting
- Want time tracking
- Enterprise-style workflows

**Skip:**
- Jira (same features, costs $6/user/month)

### Medium Team (5-10 people)
**Recommendation**: **GitHub Issues** or **Azure DevOps**

**Both are still FREE for you!**

**GitHub Issues:**

## 📊 ROI Calculation

### GitHub Issues
```
Cost: $0/year
Time to setup: 1 hour
Time saved: 5 hours/month (vs manual tracking)
Annual value: 60 hours saved = $3,000 (at $50/hr)
ROI: Infinite (free + saves time)
```

### Jira
```
Cost: $72/year
Time to setup: 8 hours
Time saved: 6 hours/month (vs GitHub)
Annual value: 72 hours saved = $3,600
ROI: ($3,600 - $72 - $400 setup) / $72 = 43x
```

**Verdict**: Both have great ROI, but GitHub is free and simpler for your current needs.
