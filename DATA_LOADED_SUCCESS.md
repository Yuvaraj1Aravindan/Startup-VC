5. **Verification:** Confirmed all data via GET requests with auth tokens

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /health` - Health check (public)

- `POST /api/token` - Authentication (public)
- `GET /api/users/me` - Current user info (authenticated)
- `POST /api/vc/usecases` - Create VC use case (authenticated, vc_representative role)
- `GET /api/vc/usecases` - List VC use cases (authenticated)
- `POST /api/ideas` - Create startup idea (authenticated, startup_aspirant role)
- `GET /api/ideas` - List startup ideas (authenticated)

### Script Used

**Location:** `/scripts/load-sample-data.sh`

**Features:**
- Automated health checks
- User account creation with error handling
- JWT token authentication
- Bulk data loading with rate limiting (500ms delays)
- Colored console output for status tracking
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Configuration Fix Applied

### Issue Identified
The nginx reverse proxy was incorrectly rewriting `/api/*` paths, causing 404 errors for API endpoints.

### Original Configuration
```nginx
location /api {
    rewrite ^/api/(.*) /$1 break;  # ‚ùå This was stripping /api prefix
    proxy_pass http://backend;
    ...
}
```

### Fixed Configuration
```nginx
location /api {
    proxy_pass http://backend;  # ‚úÖ Pass through /api prefix as-is
    ...
}
```

### Resolution
- Updated `nginx.conf` locally
- Copied to VM via SCP
- Restarted nginx container: `sudo docker compose restart nginx`
- Verified API endpoints working correctly

## Next Steps

### 1. Setup Playwright Testing ‚è≥
- Install Playwright: `npm init playwright@latest`
- Create test suite covering:
  - User registration and authentication
  - VC use case creation and listing
  - Startup idea submission and matching
  - Scoring algorithm validation
  - Cross-browser compatibility (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - Mobile responsive design
- Run tests against http://4.213.154.131

### 2. Share with Stakeholders üìß
Create email/notification with:
- Application URL: http://4.213.154.131
- Demo credentials (vc@demo.com, startup@demo.com)
- API documentation link
- Feature overview and use case examples
- Expected latency by region:
  - India (Central): 10-50ms
  - Asia: 50-100ms
  - Europe: 150-200ms
  - USA: 200-300ms

### 3. Setup Cost Controls üí∞
Run `./setup-cost-controls.sh` to configure:
- **Auto-shutdown:** 6:00 PM IST daily (saves ~$12-15/month)
- **Billing Alerts:** $50, $75, $90 thresholds
- **Budget:** $100 monthly limit
- **Impact:** Without controls: 1.2 months runtime
             With auto-shutdown: 2-3 months runtime

### 4. Monitor Application üìä
- Check VM memory usage: `free -h` (currently 15% usage, 6.3 GB available)
- Monitor Docker containers: `docker ps` and `docker stats`
- Review logs: `docker logs vc_backend_prod`
- Check API health: `curl http://4.213.154.131/health`

---

## Troubleshooting

### If API endpoints return 404:
1. Check nginx configuration is correct (no path rewriting for /api)
2. Restart nginx: `sudo docker compose restart nginx`
3. Check nginx logs: `sudo docker logs vc_nginx`

### If authentication fails:
1. Verify user exists: Check database or try registering again
2. Check password complexity requirements
3. Verify role is one of: `vc_representative`, `startup_aspirant`, `system_admin`

### If data doesn't appear:
1. Login with correct role (VC for use cases, Startup for ideas)
2. Ensure using authentication header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
3. Check backend logs: `sudo docker logs vc_backend_prod`
