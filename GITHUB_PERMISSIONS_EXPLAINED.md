# 1. Fork your repo
# 2. Make changes in their fork
# 3. Submit a Pull Request

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Issues Are Public (By Design)

**This is GOOD for:**
- Bug reports from users
- Feature requests from community
- Questions and discussions
- Building reputation/portfolio

**To prevent spam:**
- Use issue templates (already done ✅)
- Moderate and close spam issues
- Lock issues if needed
- Use labels to organize

### 2. Anyone Can Fork (This is Normal!)

**This is GOOD:**
- Others can experiment without affecting you
- Encourages contributions
- Your code gets more visibility
- Good for open source

**Your protection:**
- They can't push to YOUR repository
- You must approve all PRs
- You control what gets merged

### 3. Your Code is Safe

**Even though it's public:**
- ❌ No one can delete your code
- ❌ No one can push changes without your approval
- ❌ No one can change your settings
- ✅ You have complete control
